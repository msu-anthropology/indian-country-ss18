This is Indian Country

http://msu-anthropology.github.io/indian-country-ss18/

Collaborative project in the Spring 2018 ANP 433: Contemporary American Indian Communities class at Michigan State University. Students all chose a specific issue affecting a particular community on which to write an analytical essay. They created the webpage for the atlas entry (basic HTML, CSS, and some light JS if they felt ambitious), added the pin to the map by adding their site's information (Lat/Lon, time period, brief site description) to a CSV via Google Docs.  Leaflet Omnivore (https://github.com/mapbox/leaflet-omnivore) was used to pull the data out of the CSV and onto a simple Leaflet based map.  In addition to doing focused research and writing on specific American Indian communities, students learned basic HTML/CSS and GitHub (forking, pull requests, comitting, etc) during the course of the assignment.  

This is a semester-specific version of This is Indian Country. For the final version updated after every iteration of this couse project, visit http://msu-anthropology.github.io/indian-country, or view its files on GitHub at http://github.com/msu-anthropology/indian-country.

The project has several goals.  First, it allows the students to have focused, activist-oriented engagement with a specific issue concerning a specific community (and write about it).  Second, students will learn some digital skills during the process, such as working with HTML, digital mapping skills, version control, etc (things that are normally not part of a senior level archaeology class...things that they can easily apply in other settings). Finally, students will build something public, meaning they will contribute to the collective knowledge and resources available on the open web about various American Indian communities.

This project is a direct child of the Digital Atlas of Egyptian Archaeology (https://github.com/matrix-msu/daea), a course project developed by Ethan Watrall (https://github.com/watrall). Both This is Indian Country and DAEA were developed in partnership with LEADR at MSU (http://leadr.msu.edu) and especially through the efforts of Brian Geyer (https://github.com/geyerbri).

(much of this README comes from the DAEA README)
