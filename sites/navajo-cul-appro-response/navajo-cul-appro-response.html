      <h1>Responding to Cultural Appropriation</h1>
      <h3>Navajo Nation</h3>
	  <h4>Alex Walschots</h4>
         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>Throughout the U.S., nobody is stranger to the countless forms of cultural appropriation that is still circling with society today. We see it in our halloween costumes, our sports teams, and even television shows/movies. With all of the appropriation that surrounds our daily life, many instances seem to pass right under our noses. One of the biggest, and yet most ignored, examples of cultural appropriation in the United States is within fashion. From the runway to the hallway, people all throughout America are buying and selling items that include “native” patterns and “tribal” styles. Most big brand companies are completely unaware of this offense, and continue to make money off the objectification of Native American cultures. One of the most recent and publicized instances of this is the court case between the Urban Outfitters corporation and the Navajo Nation. </p>

		  <h3>Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>“The Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-644) is a truth-in-advertising law that prohibits misrepresentation in marketing of Indian arts and crafts products within the United States. It is illegal to offer or display for sale, or sell any art or craft product in a manner that falsely suggests it is Indian produced, an Indian product, or the product of a particular Indian or Indian Tribe or Indian arts and crafts organization, resident within the United States. For a first time violation of the Act, an individual can face civil or criminal penalties up to a $250,000 fine or a 5-year prison term, or both. If a business violates the Act, it can face civil penalties or can be prosecuted and fined up to $1,000,000.” (The Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990) </p>

		  <h3>Urban Outfitters vs. Navajo Nation</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>In the year 2012, American clothing company Urban Outfitters released a line of clothes and accessories under the label “Navajo” or “Navaho.” This was distributed to all of their subsidiaries, including the the equally as popular Anthropologie and Free People. The line included geometric patterns of navy blue, red, orange, and cream, and, if this statement was not enough to cause outrage, pairs of underwear labeled “Navajo Hipster Panty” were released as well as a flask for liquor. After all of the stereotypes connecting Native Americans with alcohol abuse, this turned into just some examples of the extreme distaste and ignorance that Urban Outfitters displayed. Without surprise, the Navajo Nation responded quickly to the appropriation, and filed a lawsuit against the company for using their name and displaying false information about Navajo culture. They directly claimed that Urban Outfitters violated the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990, and, with the violation of trademark, the lawsuit sought compensation. (Navajo Sues, 2012) </p>
		 <p2>In response to these claims, Urban Outfitters quickly fought back with claiming that the Nation does not in fact own their own name, and the prints used in their line have been ones used for decades. “The term ‘navajo’ is a common, generic term widely used in the industry and by customers to describe a design/style or feature of clothing and clothing accessories, and therefore, is incapable of trademark protection,” a court document stated. (Navajo Nation, 2016) Due to the fact that the Navajo did not take action when other companies were spreading their name for their products, they have, theoretically, “forfeited” their rights to the name. The big-brand company even used the term “culturally sophisticated” to reference their target audience that purchases the “Navajo” themed panties. </p2>

		 <p3>Eventually, after years of waiting and deliberating, this lawsuit came to a bittersweet conclusion on September 29, 2016. Urban Outfitters had won the case with their right to sell what they wish, but now, after considering the serious outrage, it was under the condition that the Navajo Nation educate the company on the true cultures and styles, and sell accordingly. </p3>
		 
		 <p4>“We are a proud nation with talented artisans, scientists, lawyers and professionals who together represent the Navajo Nation,” Navajo President Russell Begaye said during the case. “We believe in protecting our Nation, our artisans, designs, prayers and way of life.” (Navajo Nation, 2016) </p4>
		 
		 <p5>Prior as well as following the case, the conversation on culture appropriation did not cease. Boycotts broke out, and direct letters to the company grew. A prominent figure in the fight to end appropriation for the sake of fashion was Sasha Houston Brown, a member of the Sioux Nation. Her letter to the company, titled “An Open Letter to Urban Outfitters on Columbus Day,” went viral 1 year before they were officially sued. “Urban Outfitters Inc. has taken Indigenous lifeways and artistic expressions and trivialized and sexualized them for the sake of corporate profit,” Brown writes. “Your company also perpetuates the worst stereotype of Indians. This is theft of our very cultural identity, no less so than the theft of our traditional homelands that began with Columbus’ “discovery” of the Americas. On this day that America still celebrates as Columbus Day, I ask that do what is morally right and apologize to Indigenous peoples of North America and withdraw this offensive line from retail stores.” (An Open Letter, 2011) </p5>
		 
		 <p6>As long as there are people such as Brown and Begaye who continue to fight for Native American rights, process will continue to be made. </p7>
