      <h1>Gaming in Florida Seminole Nation</h1>
	  <h4>Hannah Weeks</h4>
         <h3>About the Seminole Tribe</h3> 
		 <div align="center"><hr></div><!-- this draws a line across the page, --> 
		 <p>The Florida Seminole tribe is the only federally-recognized tribe in America who hasn't signed a peace treaty and prides itself on its origins dating back for 12,000 years. Their lands lie primarily in central Florida. This tribal nation was a nation that made it's living on many different ways that include gaming, though, that isn't the only way in which they do. Recently, a man by the name of James Billie was elected Tribal Council Chairman. It was under his leadership that the tribe has matured in many different ways. The goal of the Seminole tribe has always been for self-reliance and they've been taking many steps in that direction.  The Seminole people are descendants of the Creek people.</p>
		 <p>The existence of several different gaming facilities are just the beginning of their profit. They also opened up a hotel called the Sheraton Tampa East which is solely based near Tampa, Florida. The economy around them has been increasingly strengthening due to the businesses that are being added to it, as well as contribution to education. Their primary goal is to keep up the richness of their culture, in the midst of the presence of their presence in the economy whether gaming or another way of means. The advantages of the gaming casinos support the economy with both profit for housing, education, and health services. According to their official website, they employ over 7,000 employees in between their gaming facilities, as well as other businesses. </p>
		 <p>Gaming on it's own had been going on for sure since 1979 when the Seminole tribe opened up a high stakes bingo parlor, however, there was a large issue in this. It didn't conform to laws currently being held at the time so it was considered illegal. When they took it to court, the Native Americans won the Appeal. Since that bingo parlor, the gaming facilities have continued to grow from some being in Tampa or Immokalee.

		 <h4>The Present</h4>
		 <hr>
		 <p>In present day, the tribe Seminoles live out in central Florida. It's an area of land in which they've been residing in for quite a long time, however, it's origins can be traced back to what seems to be almost 12,000 years. It's an old tribe with a rich history. </p>
		 <p> In November of 2007, it was noted that while the Seminole seemed to be doing well financially, they stilled seemed to be very dependent on the government for financial reasons. Apparently, the tribe was known to bring in more than one billion a year. The grants have been from anything from health care, education, law enforcement or even housing. This is something really important to remember because the Seminole Indians aren't subjected to property taxes on the reservation land but they do pay federal land. The difference between the two can still help them. " In a five year period ending in 2005, the tribe took in $3.2 billion in revenues and collected $80 million in government aid, according to the tribes audits" (Kestin et. al, 2007). With all the profit the Seminole nation is making it's understandable that they would be able to use some of that profit to go toward more endeavors such as more casinos or other businesses such as hotels, housing or preserving their culture such as the museum, Al-Tah-Thi-Ki. Their other modes of income just happened to be alligator wrestling, crafts, weaving, cattle and gaming. Their primary mode of income in the beginning was the upkeep or taking care of cattle, though, females did tend to be known for taking care of both the weaving and doing crafts on a regular basis.</p>
		 <p>The "sweetgrass" baskets have been made for over 60 years. The sweetgrass from the baskets is picked from dry areas from the Everglades basin, laid in the sun to dry and then woven together with colorful thread. They typically use similar threads each time as they are both easy to use and better to go with the sweetgrass.

		<h4>Gaming in the Economy</h4>
		 <hr>
		 <p>In 1979, The Seminole Nation opened the first high-stakes tribally-run casino called Hollywood Bingo in North America. The author, Jessica Cattelino, states that "This act began a slow but steady journey from crushing poverty to economic comfort" (Cattelino, 2000). 
		 <p>It's easy to debate whether or not gaming and cultural matters really do affect one another but there are varying opinions on the matter. In one opinion, it's stated that " Seminole cultural values and economic development have been inextricably intertwined throughout the last century. Indeed, culture and economy cannot be analyzed as separate categories in this context but are mutually constitutive" according to the article of 'Casino Roots: The Cultural Production of Twentieth Century Seminole Economic Development.' by Jessica Cattelino. I believe that there is very good reasons behind this to believe that this may be true, and the point is that if that were the case then there is also the concern of loss effect on their culture.</p> 
		 <p>The Seminole Nation have been known to be able to bring in income through various means. They are able to raise cattle, as well, as have alligator wrestling.  </p>
		 <h4>Ah- Tah- Thi- Ki Museum </h4>
		 <p>In the Seminole language, Ah-Tah-Thi-Ki means a 'place to learn' and it lies in the Everglades of Florida. The goal of this museum is to preserve the Seminole culture for the present and future generations. A lot of there collections and items are based on based on culture from the Southeastern Native American populations according to their official website. There are concerns that the surrounding gaming economy could have affected the culture of this tribe. The primary point that the museum was built was so that present and future generations wouldn't forget what their culture was based on and to preserve that culture. With any community, sometimes a group of people can stumble on rough times or even can come upon a cause for profit that can help a certain issue that has been going on where they lived. Within the museum, there lies many different items such as manuscripts, woven clothes, and literature. The primary point of each and every one of these is that they represent each of it's own special and unique culture. The existence of this museum has been in play for many years but is home to around 180,000 artifacts. A lot of what keeps the museum going is really due to the tribe, however, they due accept donations which can be a major help.</p>
		 <p> Since the museum encourages the role of younger children learning their culture, then they can often hold special holidays and feature days for outreach and awareness. One example of this is on June 16th, they feature Art at Ah-Tah-Thi-Ki day, where they learn from many Seminole artists and perhaps be inspired on their own. One thing I very much appreciated in learning about both this culture and this museum is that it really encourages individuality. Along the walls, it features the creative drawings or art of the young children and nowadays, you don't see that in every single museum you enter. I have to say that that really connects again to how they're trying to stay in touch with both their people and culture.
		 <p>The role of both the museum and other things such as housing is actually quite significant because you really begin to learn just how much gaming and perhaps the economy can affect your economy. When I first heard about these Native American Gaming Casinos, they could both surprise but rather make me understand. I could understand that by having the casinos that they could make a lot more money, but at the same time I hadn't known about it at before. The issues with these types of casinos is that it may be easy to lose that type of identity with your culture. You begin to work among casino and realize that unintentionally by doing so you lose touch with your own religion. The museum of Al-Tah-Thi-Ki was built to help the Seminole both understand their history, and to connect.</p>

		 <h4>Tribal Council and Government</h4>
		 <hr>
		 <p> By 1957, a constitution was formed establishing a two part or two-tiered government that consisted of a Board of Directors and a Tribal Council. The representation would be elected from the community and this would be a beneficial thing because it would guarantee the voice of the community was likely being spoken. The council was and is the main governing part of the Seminole Community. However, there did exist some political turmoil later on that caused some people in this culture to sought independence on their own. The Seminole Tribal Court is another separate but equal part of the branch of the Seminole Tribe of the Florida Government. It's in this type of government that it covers a range of domestic disputes. When the first Seminole government was established, there was also the opportunity to set up a tribal treasury. It was with the help of the tribal treasury combined with their tourism ventures like the boat rides, gaming, crafts, and wrestling that profit and income increased.  </p>
