      <h1>Gaming in Florida Seminole Nation</h1>
	  <h4>Hannah Weeks</h4>
	  
         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <p>In the southern United States, there lives a native American tribe who has been living in the Everglades for several years. The Seminole people of today had many, around 200,000 ancestors who lived in or around Florida when the Spaniards discovered Florida in 1513. It was the U.S. citizens that would eventually dub the Native Americans as the Seminoles after cimarrones or free people according to their official history. </p>
		 <p>The stereotypes surrounding this topic are varied and many. Many people believe that the Seminole are entirely dependent on gaming while still others believe that their culture isn’t a large part of their life any longer. The casinos were originally built to help build a struggling group but then when that group began to get wealthier then they managed to stay. All along, there were still other methods of income: managing cattle, crafting, weaving, and alligator wrestling. The reality that the economy has always been is that it has improved from a bingo to a several million dollar economy.  </p>
		 <p>Similar to many other Native American tribes, it does have it's own history. In today's world, it was before WWII that the Seminole in Florida divided into two groups. One group was willing to live on reservation lands and adapt to new changes and the other still followed the more Traditional ways according to their official website (2018). The first became known as The Seminole of Florida and lived in the Everglades and the second also were named as the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida. As mentioned later, the Seminole did gain federal recognition later in 1957, got reservation lands and sought control of the wetlands. Today, the Seminole Tribe of Florida is headquartered in Hollywood, Florida (also where one of their major gaming casinos is present).
		 <h4>About the Seminole Tribe</h4> 
		 <div align="center"><hr></div><!-- this draws a line across the page, --> 
		 <p>The Florida Seminole tribe is the only federally-recognized tribe in America who hasn't signed a peace treaty and prides itself on its origins dating back for 12,000 years. Their lands lie primarily in central Florida. This tribal nation was a nation that made it's living on many different ways that include gaming, though, that isn't the only way in which they do. Recently, a man by the name of James Billie was elected Tribal Council Chairman. It was under his leadership that the tribe has matured in many different ways. The goal of the Seminole tribe has always been for self-reliance and they've been taking many steps in that direction.  The Seminole people are descendants of the Creek people.</p>
		 <p>The existence of several different gaming facilities are just the beginning of their profit. They also opened up a hotel called the Sheraton Tampa East which is solely based near Tampa, Florida. The economy around them has been increasingly strengthening due to the businesses that are being added to it, as well as contribution to education (Jason, 2016). Their primary goal is to keep up the richness of their culture, in the midst of the presence of their presence in the economy whether gaming or another way of means. The advantages of the gaming casinos support the economy with both profit for housing, education, and health services. According to their official website, they employ over 7,000 employees in between their gaming facilities, as well as other businesses. It was on August 21st, 1957 the Seminole tribe voted to create the Seminole tribe of Florida. </p>
		 <p>Gaming on it's own had been going on for sure since 1979 when the Seminole tribe opened up a high stakes bingo parlor on the Dania reservation (Fletcher, 2014), however, there was a large issue in this. It didn't conform to laws currently being held at the time so it was considered illegal. When they took it to court, the Native Americans won the Appeal (d,Errico, 2016). Since that bingo parlor, the gaming facilities have continued to grow from some being in Tampa or Immokalee (Cattelino, 2000). </p>
		 <h4>Tribal Council and Government</h4>
		 <hr>
		 <p>By 1957, a constitution was formed establishing a two part or two-tiered government that consisted of a Board of Directors and a Tribal Council. The representation would be elected from the community and this would be a beneficial thing because it would guarantee the voice of the community was likely being spoken. The council was and is the main governing part of the Seminole Community. However, there did exist some political turmoil later on that caused some people in this culture to sought independence on their own. The Seminole Tribal Court is another separate but equal part of the branch of the Seminole Tribe of the Florida Government. It's in this type of government that it covers a range of domestic disputes. When the first Seminole government was established, there was also the opportunity to set up a tribal treasury. It was with the help of the tribal treasury combined with their tourism ventures like the boat rides, gaming, crafts, and wrestling that profit and income increased.</p>

		 <h4>The Present</h4>
		 <hr>
		 <p>In present day, the tribe Seminoles live out in central Florida. It's an area of land in which they've been residing in for quite a long time, however, it's origins can be traced back to what seems to be almost 12,000 years. It's an old tribe with a rich history. </p>
		 <p> In November of 2007, it was noted that while the Seminole seemed to be doing well financially, they stilled seemed to be very dependent on the government for financial reasons. Apparently, the tribe was known to bring in more than one billion a year. The grants have been from anything from health care, education, law enforcement or even housing. This is something really important to remember because the Seminole Indians aren't subjected to property taxes on the reservation land but they do pay federal land. The difference between the two can still help them. " In a five year period ending in 2005, the tribe took in $3.2 billion in revenues and collected $80 million in government aid, according to the tribes audits" (Kestin et. al, 2007). With all the profit the Seminole nation is making it's understandable that they would be able to use some of that profit to go toward more endeavors such as more casinos or other businesses such as hotels, housing or preserving their culture such as the museum, Al-Tah-Thi-Ki. Their other modes of income just happened to be alligator wrestling, crafts, weaving, cattle and gaming. Their primary mode of income in the beginning was the upkeep or taking care of cattle, though, females did tend to be known for taking care of both the weaving and doing crafts on a regular basis.</p>
		 <p>The "sweetgrass" baskets have been made for over 60 years. The sweetgrass from the baskets is picked from dry areas from the Everglades basin, laid in the sun to dry and then woven together with colorful thread. They typically use similar threads each time as they are both easy to use and better to go with the sweetgrass.

		<h4>Gaming in the Economy</h4>
		 <hr>
		 <p>In 1979, The Seminole Nation opened the first high-stakes tribally-run casino called Hollywood Bingo in North America. The author, Jessica Cattelino, states that "This act began a slow but steady journey from crushing poverty to economic comfort" (Cattelino, 2000). The casino called Hollywood Bingo lies near Miami, Florida. With this development, they were also able to maintain being in touch with their culture. Through public ceremonies, crafts, museums, and boat tours, they are able to teach about both their history and about their identity to other people. </p>
		 <p>It's easy to debate whether or not gaming and cultural matters really do affect one another but there are varying opinions on the matter. In one opinion, it's stated that " Seminole cultural values and economic development have been inextricably intertwined throughout the last century. Indeed, culture and economy cannot be analyzed as separate categories in this context but are mutually constitutive" according to the article of 'Casino Roots: The Cultural Production of Twentieth Century Seminole Economic Development.' by Jessica Cattelino. I believe that there is very good reasons behind this to believe that this may be true, and the point is that if that were the case then there is also the concern of loss effect on their culture.</p> 
		 <p>The Seminole Nation have been known to be able to bring in income through various means. They are able to raise cattle, as well, as have alligator wrestling (Cattelino, 2008). The profits from these ventures contribute to helping them stay independent- something that they are extremely proud of as a group of people. The Gaming industry is one that contributes to the tribes revenue and nearly $2.2 billion in 2015.
		 <p> The issue with the gaming culture is that at times it can clash with the tribe itself. Several in the economy never believed that the impact gaming could have on the tribe itself, however, there are some today that while they are doing well financially, they don't feel a part of the tribe they grew up in. It's in this case that the concern for loss of identity and perhaps, the stereotypes may have increased.
