		 <p style="text-indent: 40px">The Inupiat Eskimos are Native Alaskans whose people span from the Norton Sound on the Bering Sea to the Canada- United States boarder. (1) and have an overall population of roughly 20,700 people They, like most natives living in arctic climates, depend primarily on a subsistence strategy of whaling, hunting and fishing. Living in temperatures below freezing almost year-round, they find ways to utilize their resources to their upmost potential. Using their hunting kills for meat, clothing, and other items used for daily living. They seem to live relatively traditional lifestyles. However, statistically there seems to be high numbers of mental illness among Alaskan Natives and their Native American cousins. I believe a condition called Seasonal Affective Disorder plays a large role in this statistical disparity for Inupiat Eskimos living in the arctic.</p>

		<h3>Seasonal Affective Disorder</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p style="text-indent: 40px">Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a disorder that can affect anyone who experiences mood, energy level, libido, etc. changes based on the weather. The Mayo Clinic characterizes this as “a type of depression that's related to changes in seasons — SAD begins and ends at about the same times every year.” (2). For most people the effects of SAD manifest during the fall and winter months due to gloomier weather with less sunlight. However, for some the effects also take place during the spring and summer months with excess sun light.<br>

		 <br>Signs and Symptoms for each are below:<br>
		 <br>Fall and Winter SAD aka "Winter Depression"<br>
		 <br>Oversleeping
		 <br>Increased Appetite (Particularly for Carbohydrates)
		 <br>Weight Gain
		 <br>Tiredness or Lethargy<br>
		 <br>Spring and Summer SAD aka "Summer Depression"<br>
		 <br>Trouble Sleeping (Insomnia)
		 <br>Poor Appetite
		 <br>Weight Loss
		 <br>Agitation or Anxiety (2)
		 <br>
		 <br>
		 <br>
		 <br>Why is this such a risk for Inupiat Eskimos? Let us take a closer look at the town of Barrow, AK.</p>

		 <h3>Barrow, Alaska</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p style="text-indent: 40px">The town of Utqiaġvik, commonly called Barrow, Alaska, is the northernmost city that is part of the United States. With a population of around 4,400 people and 60.5% claiming Alaska Native (AN) or American Indian (AI) ancestry, it’s also one of the largest communities of Inupiat Eskimos in the world. Due to the arctic geographical location, these individuals experience 7-10 weeks of virtually no sunlight (polar night) (3) and roughly 10 weeks of no darkness (midnight sun) each year. It’s also completely overcast for more than 50% of the year.</pr>
		 <br>
		 <p style="text-indent: 40px">These weather extremes can cause severe changes in individuals sleep cycle, melatonin and serotonin levels. For many, this results in observable changes in mood and activities of daily living. If left unchecked, SAD can lead to depression, substance abuse, and even suicide. Some individuals believe alcohol and drugs will make them feel better when in all actuality it makes matters worse.  A study found that “lifetime prevalence rates of alcohol dependence or abuse within selected American Indian communities range from 27 to 51 percent.” (6&7) Also, a 2008 report showed AN/AI suicide rate of 13.1% vs the national average of 3.7% for those over the age of 18 (5). All of these statistics can be related to SAD and its associated symptoms.</p>

		 <h3>SAD Treatments</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->

	<figcaption>Image 3 - "SAD Treatments."</figcaption>
</figure>
		 <p style="text-indent: 40px">There are a couple options that most can seek out to help treat SAD symptoms. The more common being light therapy, medications, and psychotherapy. Sadly, due to the remote location and climate where the Inupiat Eskimos live, it’s not always easy to get the more westernized treatments. Anyone who lives just outside the city needs to be airlifted to the Samuel Simmonds Memorial Hospital for care since there are no roads leading in or out of Barrow. With that said, roughly 34-49% of Alaska Natives will seek their traditional healers to “focus on balancing mind, body and spirit within the community context” (8) before trying a westernized approach. Both of which have been shown to be successful.</pr>

		 <h3>Conclusion</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p style="text-indent: 40px">It’s very easy to see how SAD and its associated symptoms are affecting Native Alaskans today. Especially with the harsh climate and long periods of darkness and light that the Inupiat Eskimos endure through the year. The key to helping combat the high mental illness statistics is to get help when symptoms are recognized. There are SAD treatments options available. Since both westernized and traditional treatment methods have been found to be beneficial, it’s up to the person to make the call based on availability to them and their personal preference. By recognizing and seeking help they can start to reduce AN/AI mental illness statistics and start promoting better mental health within their communities.</p>
