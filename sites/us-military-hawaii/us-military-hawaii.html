		<h3>Foreign Business Interestes Beginning in 1778</h3>
			<hr>
		        <p>Hawai'i has been under the influence of foreign business since the British sailor James Cooke "discovered" the islands in 1778. 
        		Interaction with Europeans was detrimental to the <i> Kanaka Maoli </i>, Native Hawaiian, population and the <i> aina </i>, land. Foreign diseases ,like smallpox, killed many people and reduced the population exponentially. 
        		The land dispossession stemmed from capitalistic interets in resources like the sandalwood trees. The islands did not establish themselves as factors in foreign business, and were taken advantage of. 
        		Much of the land found its way in outside possession. The United States Sugar industry was probably the most socially and economically definitive for the islands. </p>
        		
        		<p> The sugar industry was composed of five companies : Hackfield and Company (Amfac), C. Brewer and Company, Theo Davis Company, Castle and Cooke, and Alexander and Baldwin. "The Big Five" controlled all 
        		The "Big Five" controlled things as big as the Hawaiian government, and as small as the price of bread. The remaining <i> Kanaka Maoli</i> became subservient to "King Sugar". Immigrant laborers were brought to the islands 
        		for sugarr production and the "Big Five" became the unofficial ruling class. The Big Five's power on the islands and influence in the U.S government 
        		eventually led to the occupancy of the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
        		
        		
         <h3>The Overthrow of Queen Liliuokalani</h3>     
            <hr>		
        	<p>Queen Liluokalani ascended the throne in 1891, and aimed to re-establish Hawaiian sovereignty. Her goal was "not to organize the Hawaiian people for an all-out struggle
        		,but rather to attack the institutions of elite control from her position as monarch." (Kent, 1983) The discussion of annexation into the 
        		United States was an ongoing debate, but the majority of the population believed in the monarchy. Queen Liliuokalani became a threat to the white 
        		business owners and they retaliated with The Committee of Public Safety. This militia composed of <i> haoles </i>, white foreigners, aimed to "restore law and order" on the islands. </p>
        		
        	<p>	The official challenge to the Big Five's power came on January 14th, 1893. Queen Liliuokalani enacted a new constitution that " asserted the power of the 
        		monarchy over the government and declared that all cabinet ministers, would henceforth serve at her pleasure". (Kent, 1983) The following day, United States military
        		Captain Wiltse of the <i> Boston </i> landed on the shores of Oahu. With the backing of the U.S military, Queen Liliuokalani
