	  <h2> Introduction </h2>
	  	
	  	<p> The ongoing occupation of the U.S Military on the Hawaiian Islands has been detrimental to the land and culture of the Indigenous People. 
	  	The site will follow key points in U.S Military history on the islands, like the military takeover of Hawaiian monarch Queen Liliuokalani and the bombing of Pearl Harbor. 
	  	The site will focus on military bases, bombing sites, and <i> Kanaka Maoli </i>, Native Hawaiians, on the Island of Hawai'i (The Big Island), Kauai, and Oahu. 
	  	These places best indicate the effects of land dispossession on the people and the land.</p>

		        <p>Hawai'i has been under the influence of foreign business since the British sailor James Cooke "discovered" the islands in 1778. 
        		Interaction with Europeans was detrimental to the <i><strong> Kanaka Maoli</strong> </i>, Native Hawaiian, population and the <i><strong> aina</strong> </i>, land. Foreign diseases ,like tuberculois, killed many people and reduced the population exponentially. (Lafrance, The Atlantic, 2015)
        		(Kent, 1983)The land dispossession stemmed from capitalistic interets in resources like the sandalwood trees. The islands did not establish themselves as factors in foreign business, and were taken advantage of. 
        		Much of the land found its way in outside possession. The United States Sugar industry was probably the most socially and economically definitive to the islands.  <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Bundy, FirstName. This is the Article Title, in This is the Journal. 2001">(Bundy 2001)</a></p>
        		
        		<p> The sugar industry was composed of five companies : Hackfield and Company (Amfac), C. Brewer and Company, Theo Davis Company, Castle and Cooke, and Alexander and Baldwin. "The Big Five" controlled all 
        		The "Big Five" controlled things as big as the Hawaiian government, and as small as the price of bread. The remaining <i> Kanaka Maoli</i> became subservient to "King Sugar". Immigrant laborers were brought to the islands 
        		for sugar production and the "Big Five" became the unofficial ruling class. The Big Five's power on the islands and influence in the U.S government led to the occupancy of the Hawaiian Islands and the annexation into the United States.</p>
        		
    <br> 
       		<h2> <i><strong>The Great Mahele 1845-1855</strong></i> </h2>
    			<hr>
    		
    		<p> <i><strong> The Great Mahele </strong> </i> is one of the most important documents regarding land dispossession of <i> <strong> Kanaka Maoli </strong> </i>. In this document, Hawaiian monarch <i><strong> King Kamehameha III </strong></i> reconfigured the laws and rights surrounding land 
    			ownership. The Great Mahele took the complete control of the land out of the monarchy, and  <i><strong> divided the land into allotments that could be placed for sale</strong></i>. This enactment was similar to the United States <strong> Dawes Act of 1887</strong> 
    			since it led to <strong> white land grab of Indigenous lands</strong>. The European ideas of individual property were forced on Indigenous people across the world but the same cannnot be said about Hawai'i. The Great Mahele was enacted by King Kamehameha III on his own accord. 
    			He was influenced by white settlers and business owners, but <strong>he was not forced by another power to create the Great Mahele</strong>. To say that those ourside of the monarchy agreed with the allotment 
    			of land would be false, but the emergence of European property laws in Hawai'i differs from other Indigenious peoples (Banner, 2005). </p>
    		
    		<p>	The Great Mahele divided Hawai'i into <strong>crown</strong> lands (that went to King Kamehameha), and <strong> government lands</strong> (that went to chiefs and the people). This act was meant to relinquish control of lands by the monarchy/government and place it into the hands of the people. Sadly, 
    			chiefs and foreigners grew to control large portions of the lands meant for the commoners. The lands allocated for commoners were not offered or the acquisition of land was made extremely difficult through unreasonable prices or the foreigners evicted rightful owners without due process (Rhodes, 2001). 
    			The redistribution of land was meant to aid the common Native Hawaiian, but in reality is placed them in a subservient postion with their government and with foreign businessmen. In the end, the overthrow of Queen Lili'uokalani in 1893 placed crown lands for sale to the public, lost to 
    			<i><strong> Kanaka Maoli</strong> </i>. The Great Mahele was meant to aid the Hawaiian kingdom, it helped with the downfall. </p>

         <h2>The Overthrow of Queen Lili'uokalani</h2>     
            <hr>	
            <figure style="float: right; width: 40%; padding-left: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px;">

					<figcaption>"Image 2- Queen Lili'uokalani, Wikipedia"</figcaption>
						</figure>	
        	<p>Queen Lili'uokalani ascended the throne in 1891, and <strong> set the goal to re-establish Hawaiian sovereignty</strong>. Her goal was "not to organize the Hawaiian people for an all-out struggle
        		,but rather to attack the institutions of elite control from her position as monarch." (Kent, 1983) The discussion of annexation into the 
        		United States was an ongoing debate, but the majority of the population believed in the monarchy. Queen Liliuokalani became a threat to the ruling white business owners because her claim to the thrown 
        		dismissed the Bayonet Constitution put into place by the Big Five.(Kent, 1983) </p>
        		
        	<p>	The official challenge came on January 14th, 1893. <i><strong>Queen Lili'uokalani</strong></i> enacted a new constitution that " asserted the power of the 
        		monarchy over the government and declared that all cabinet ministers, would henceforth serve at her pleasure". (Kent, 1983)  The Big Five retaliated with 
        		<strong>The Committee of Public Safety</strong>. This militia was composed of <i> <strong> haoles </strong> </i>, white business owners and residents, who aimed to "restore law and order" on the islands.
        		The following day, United States military invaded the island. The fleet led by Captain Wiltse of the <i> Boston </i> landed on the shores of Oahu. 
        		The queen was prepared for the fight against the Committee of Public Safety but knew an act against the U.S would mean the slaughter of her people. 
        		With the aid of the United States military, THe Committee of Public Safety overthrew the monarchy and established the Republic of Hawai'i.
        		Eventually, Hawai'i was annexed into the United States on August 21st, 1959, making the archipelago of islands the 50th state in the Union. </p>
        		
        	<p> The overthrow of <i> <strong>Queen Lili'uokalani</strong></i> was a hostile coup, and it was the beginning of the <strong>United States occupation of Hawai'i</strong>. The coup would not have succeeded without the muscle of 
        		the United States military. The Hawaiian monarchy was a recognized international power, that was illegally occupied by the United States. The United States military has altered the 
        		physical composition of the islands, and has effected the lives of <i> <strong> Kanaka Maoli </strong> </i> . </p>	
        		
    <br>
        	<h2> <strong>Location. Location. Location: The Strategic Importance of the Hawaiian Islands </strong> </h2>
    			<hr> 
    		<p> Hawaii's location in the Pacific Ocean is a <strong> safeguard </strong> to the United States commercial and military interets. The placement of military bases on the islands during the 19th and 20th century 
    			gave the military the advantage of an <strong>"unsinkable base"</strong> (Harris, 2014). Island bases were meant "tp protect and extend the reach of the US merchant marine and navy, serving as way stations and communications 
    			facilities for commercial vessels and military ships" (Harris, 2014) The islands were a line  act as a line of defense to other international military powers (like Japan and China), a means of communication across occupied 
    			Pacific Island nations, and the islands play as an economic advantage with tourism.  </p>
    			
    		<p> Hawai'i not the only island that held strategic value and they were apart of a larger picture of the United State's expansion into the Pacific. The acquired lands from the Treaty of Paris in 1898 
    			gave the United States an opportunity to take control of islands like the Philippines and Guam. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor during the Second World and the threat of Communist China during the Cold War gave the U.S 
    			and excuse to occupy islands in the Pacific. </p>

    	<h2> <i> <strong> Kanaka Maoli </strong> </i> and the <i> <strong> Aina </strong> </i> </h2>
    		<hr>
    		<h3> Genealogical Relationship to <i> Aina </i> </h3>
					
    			 <p>The idea of the <i> <strong> aina </strong> </i> (land) is intertwined with the existence of <i> <strong> Kanaka Maoli </strong> </i> (Native Hawaiians). <i> <strong> Kumulimpo </strong> </i> is the sacred chant in which the origin of Hawai'i and <i><strong>Kanaka Maoli</strong></i>.
    			  This is one of the most important chants in Native Hawaiian culture and religion. Historian  Lilikala Kameeleihiwia says the Kumulipo is " the essential lesson... that every aspect of the world is related by birth, and as such, all parts of the Hawaiian 
    			 	world are one indivisible lineage...(and) the genealogy of the Land, the Gods, the Chiefs, and people intertwine with each other, and with all the myriad aspects of the universe". (Brown, 2014) </p>
    			
    			<p> In the Kumulipo, it begins with the period of <i> Po</i>, the period of darkness. <i> <strong> Wakea </strong> </i> "The Sky Father" breaks through the darkness, and the universe is created. Later on, <i> <b> Wakea </b></i> and 
    				<i> <stong> Papa </strong></i/> "The Earth" come together and make human kind. The offspring is <i> <strong> Haloa </strong> </i>: "the progenitor of all the peoples from the earth" (Beckwith, 1951). The first 
    				<i> <strong> Haloa </strong> </i> changed to <i> ha-loa </i> is stillborn and buried named from the long stalk of the taro plant. Instances of the deities, people, earth, water, etc. 
    				are connected in the <i> <strong> Kumulimpo </strong> </i> and it best shows the harmounous interaction of the universe. </p>

		<h2> <i><strong> Weapons Testing on " The Garden Island" (Kaua'i)</strong></i> </h2>

						<figcaption>Image 3 - "Na Pali Coast, Kaua'i. hawaiistateparks.org "</figcaption>
							</figure>
				
				<p> <i><strong>The Pacific Military Range Facility Barking Sands (PMRF) </strong></i> has occupied land on Kaua'i since the 1940s. Beginning as a simple air field, they evolved into a complex missile testing and training facility that can "support surface, subsurface, air, and space training scenarios". (Letman, 2017) 
					Government agencies like NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration), the Missle Defense Agency (MDA), and most importantly The United States Military continue to use this base for various field experiments.  The PMRF is controlled by the United States Navy and <i><storng>holds "over 1,100 square miles of 
					instrumented underwater range and over 42,000 square miles of controlled airspace"</strong></i>.(Pacific Missle Range Barking Sands website) 
					
				<p>	PMRF resides on land was once owned by the Kekaha Sugar Company. The company was founded by Valdemar Knudsen in 1856, and I speculate the land acquired by Knudsen came from the recent redistribution of land in <i><strong> The Great Mahele </strong> </i>. The company history indicates Knudsen "acquired a 30-year
					lease on crown lands in the Waimea" found in the south-western portion of the Kaui'i. (Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association University of Hawai'i at Manoa, 2004) If Knudsen was one of the many foreign businessmen that targeted the islands in the redistribution of land, the United States military's purchase of the Barking Sands
					(the foundation to the current PMRF) airfield indicates land dispossession existed with capitalistic interets and went forward with the U.S military's occupation of the Hawaiian Islands.

							</figure>	
							   
				<p>	The Pacific Military Range Facility is unique to other U.S Military locations on the islands because of their <strong> control of the seas</strong>. "Warning zones" or "exclusion zones" are declared for missle testing sites and field exercises. People are either strongly advised or completely excluded 
					from entering these zones on the sea (Dyke, 2002). These zones can be detrimental to fishing economies, and can place fear in residents of Kaui'i. In an article by the the Kaui'i newspaper <i> The Garden Island </i>, the United States military dismisses involvement the death of male trigger fish 
					<i><strong> Humuhumu </strong></i>(Zickos, 2009). Although a representative claims there were no tests that would "harm fish or maritime mammals", reservations were held about the "testing" that occurred during the fish kills. 
					
				<p> There is an obvious difference between the image of Na' Pali coast and the Pacific Missle Range Facility (PMRF). Kaui'i is known as "the Garden Island" but the image of the Pacific Missle Range Facility demonstrates an almost baren landscape, with little vegetation. This is a stark difference to the 
					lush green hills on Na'Pali coast. Both images demonstrate the unspoken, and for many, unknown military occupancy on the Kaui'i.

    			<p> Found on the Big Island (Island of Hawai'i) is <i> <strong> Mauna Kea </strong> </i>, the largest mountain in the world. This mountain holds a spiritual significance between <i> <strong> Kanaka Maoli </strong> </i> and the <i> <strong> aina </strong> </i> (land).
    			(Hawaii Center of Volcanology, 2008) In the <i> <b> Kumulimpo </b> </i>, this mountain is known as <i> <strong> kino lau</strong></i> the physical form of the Gods. Hundeds of <i><strong>heiau</strong></i> (temples/shrines) are placed around the mountain honoring the Gods. 
    			<i> <strong> Mauna Kea </strong></i> is the beginning of Hawaiian existence, a product of <i> <b> Wakea </b></i> and <i> <stong> Papa </strong></i/>. This sacred moutnatin was the "<i>first born child of Hawai'i</i>". (Lafrance, 2015) </p> 
    			
    			<p> In 2015, the fight for Mauna Kea ensued between astronomers and Native Hawaiian activist. <i> <strong> Mauna Kea's </strong> </i> postion as the largest mountain in the world made it the prime candidate for the <i><strong> Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT)</strong></i>. 
    				The TMT would be built on top of the mountain, allowing astronomers to expand their knowledge of the cosmos. As the sacred place it is, if the telescope was built, it would've meant the degradation of Indigenous culture and sovereignty. The fight for Mauna Kea is a fight to preserve Hawaiian culture 
    				but it is also the fight is against land dispossession. If the TMT telescope was built, it would have meant a further loss of land to Native Hawaiians, along with the environmental degradation. A number of telescopes already exist on the mountain, but they were 
    				without consent of Native Hawaiian people. The  <i><strong> Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT)</strong></i> would have been another seizure of Native land, sacred land at that.
