	  <h2> Introduction </h2>
	  	
	  	<p> The ongoing occupation of the U.S Military on the Hawaiian Islands has been detrimental to the land and culture of the Indigenous People. 
	  	The site will follow key points in U.S Military history on the islands, like the military takeover of Hawaiian monarch Queen Liliuokalani and the bombing of Pearl Harbor. 
	  	The site will focus on military bases, bombing sites, and <i> Kanaka Maoli </i>, Native Hawaiians, on the Island of Hawai'i (The Big Island), Kauai, and Oahu. 
	  	These places best indicate the effects of land dispossession on the people and the land.</p>

		        <p>Hawai'i has been under the influence of foreign business since the British sailor James Cooke "discovered" the islands in 1778. 
        		Interaction with Europeans was detrimental to the <i> Kanaka Maoli </i>, Native Hawaiian, population and the <i> aina </i>, land. Foreign diseases ,like smallpox, killed many people and reduced the population exponentially. 
        		The land dispossession stemmed from capitalistic interets in resources like the sandalwood trees. The islands did not establish themselves as factors in foreign business, and were taken advantage of. 
        		Much of the land found its way in outside possession. The United States Sugar industry was probably the most socially and economically definitive for the islands <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Bundy, FirstName. This is the Article Title, in This is the Journal. 2001">(Bundy 2001)</a></p>
        		
        		<p> The sugar industry was composed of five companies : Hackfield and Company (Amfac), C. Brewer and Company, Theo Davis Company, Castle and Cooke, and Alexander and Baldwin. "The Big Five" controlled all 
        		The "Big Five" controlled things as big as the Hawaiian government, and as small as the price of bread. The remaining <i> Kanaka Maoli</i> became subservient to "King Sugar". Immigrant laborers were brought to the islands 
        		for sugarr production and the "Big Five" became the unofficial ruling class. The Big Five's power on the islands and influence in the U.S government 
        		eventually led to the occupancy of the Hawaiian Islands.</p>

         <h2>The Overthrow of Queen Lili'uokalani</h2>     
            <hr>	
            <figure style="float: right; width: 40%; padding-left: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px;">

						</figure>	
        	<p>Queen Lili'uokalani ascended the throne in 1891, and set the goal to re-establish Hawaiian sovereignty. Her goal was "not to organize the Hawaiian people for an all-out struggle
        		,but rather to attack the institutions of elite control from her position as monarch." (Kent, 1983) The discussion of annexation into the 
        		United States was an ongoing debate, but the majority of the population believed in the monarchy. Queen Liliuokalani became a threat to the ruling white business owners because her claim to the thrown 
        		dismissed the Bayonet Constitution put into place by the Big Five. </p>
        		
        	<p>	The official challenge came on January 14th, 1893. Queen Lili'uokalani enacted a new constitution that " asserted the power of the 
        		monarchy over the government and declared that all cabinet ministers, would henceforth serve at her pleasure". (Kent, 1983)  The Big Five retaliated with 
        		The Committee of Public Safety. This militia was composed of <i> haoles </i>, white business owners and residents, who aimed to "restore law and order" on the islands.
        		The following day, United States military invaded the island. The fleet led by Captain Wiltse of the <i> Boston </i> landed on the shores of Oahu. 
        		The queen was prepared for the fight against the Committee of Public Safety but knew an act against the U.S would mean the slaughter of her people. 
        		With the aid of the United States military, THe Committee of Public Safety overthrew the monarchy and established the Republic of Hawai'i.
        		Eventually, Hawai'i was annexed into the United States on August 21st, 1959, making the archipelago of islands the 50th state in the Union. </p>
        		
        	<p> The overthrow of Queen Lili'uokalani was a hostile coup, was the beginning of the United States occupation of Hawai'i. The coup would not have succeeded without the muscle of 
        		the United States military. The Hawaiian monarchy was a recognized international power, that was illegally occupied by the United States. The United States military has altered the 
        		physical composition of the islands, and has effected the lives of <i> Kanaka Maoli </i> . </p>	
        		
    	<br>
        	<h2> Location. Location. Location: The Strategic Importance of the Hawaiian Islands</h2>
    			<hr> 
    		<p> Hawaii's location in the Pacific Ocean is a safeguard to the United States commercial and military interets. The placement of military bases on the islands during the 19th and 20th century 
    			gave the military the advantage of an "unsinkable base" (Harris, 2014). Island bases were meant "tp protect and extend the reach of the US merchant marine and navy, serving as way stations and communications 
    			facilities for commercial vessels and military ships" (Harris, 2014) The islands were a line  act as a line of defense to other international military powers (like Japan and China), a means of communication across occupied 
    			Pacific Island nations, and the islands play as an economic advantage with tourism.  
    			
    		<p> Hawai'i not the only island that held strategic value and they were apart of a larger picture of the United State's expansion into the Pacific. The acquired lands from the Treaty of Paris in 1898 
    			gave the United States an opportunity to take control of islands like the Philippines and Guam. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor during the Second World and the threat of Communist China during the Cold War gave the U.S 
    			and excuse to occupy islands in the Pacific.
