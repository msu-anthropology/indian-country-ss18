         <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
		 <hr> <color: black</>
		 <p>Teenagers in the Navajo tribe have among the highest rates of teenage pregnancy, they are about 15.8% higher than the national average, and the lowest rates of contraceptive use in the United States. 65% of males, and 57% of females report having sexual intercourse by/before the 12th grade, but only half of those reporting having sex report always using contraceptives. This can have extreme consequences, such as educational deficits, economic strain, and can cause reservations to have a higher concentration of poverty, or extreme poverty.</p>

		 <h3>What is sexual education like in reservation schools?</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p> Sexual education is not a subject that is often broached by reservation schools, or even passed on from mothers to daughters or fathers to sons. Off-reservation schools are especially insensitive to Indigenous women, and often, dating Indigenous women in high school is viewed as a sexual activity, rather than a romantic one. The Navajo reservation is the state’s highest ‘out of wed-lock’ birth location (Dehyle, 1995).
Typically, traditional Native American cultures tended to be egalitarian, and often marriage is viewed as being neither religious, nor civil. Marriage seems to be much more open and even celebratory of/about members sexuality (Traditional Views of Sex and Marriage). 
HIV rates are often higher among Indigenous Peoples than white people, but are still relatively low overall. Although relatively low as well, gonorrhea was the highest rate, 5x more prevalent in Indigenous women than in white women, and 3.9x more prevalent in men. Chlamydia is the second highest rate, being overall 4x more prevalent than in Caucasian people (STI Infection Rates).
