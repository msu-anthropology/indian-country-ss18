		 <h3><em><font face="lucida bright">Introduction</font></em></h3>
		 <p>From foreign contact to statehood, the prostitution of Hawaiian culture for economic and corporate gain has negatively affected Native communities of Hawaii. The tourism industry completely contradicts and destroys its host culture while simultaneously bleeding the culture dry of its natural resources, social and economic standing, and cultural values by turning their culture into a commodity. It demonstrates the moral injustice of consciously putting financial gain ahead of preserving and respecting its native host culture. Native Hawaiian communities live in economic and political degradation with tourism industries encroaching on their rights to natural resources, land, and basic living conditions. The very institution that is completely dependent on Hawaiian culture is knowingly worsening the preservation of its hosts beautiful culture.
		 <h3><em><font face="lucida bright">From Contact to Statehood</font></em></h3>
		 <p>Contact between the United States of America and the Kingdom of Hawaii created a downward spiral of loss of identity and cultural solidarity between the Native Hawaiian communities. The relationship between the United States and Hawaii followed the U.S. expansion of power throughout the Caribbean during the 1890s causing the US to become a world power in distant countries around the North American continent.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="refl">1</a></sup> Economic turned into political influences upon the Hawaiian monarchy due to the vast amounts of commercial interaction it had with the United States government.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup></p> 
		 <p>Soon the United States government took ahold of the Hawaiian monarchy eventually overthrowing the crown for its own economic and power hungry greed. Expensive commodities such as pineapple, sugar, and expansionist ideologies were the most alluring to the American government and economy subsequently causing the action of annexation of Hawai’i in 1898 despite unprecedented opposition of Native Hawaiian residents. The protests to annexation by the Indigenous community of Hawaii caused foreign policy complications right from the start. Two years after the annexation of 1898, Hawai’i became a United States territory in 1900 and later the fiftieth state in 1959.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> Unethically acquiring the Kingdom of Hawai’i, even to this day, the legitimacy of this annexation under U.S. constitutional law is rightfully scrutinized.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup></p>

		 <h3><em><font face="lucida bright">Tourism</font></em></h3>
		 <p>The United States control over the Hawaiian Islands came from the economic trade benefits of commodities like sugar and pineapple however the U.S. government began to see the value of Hawai’i’s tropical paradise in relation to the socioeconomic changes in mainland American society.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>  As the twentieth century progressed, the newly emerged American middle class began to have access to international travel. Jet liners, a prosperous economy, more leisure time, and a morbid intrigue of experiencing ‘otherness’ and new places untouched by American capitalism and industrialism caused an influx of tourism into the Hawaiian Islands.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> Around the time of statehood, tourism expanded and soon advertised Hawai’i as America’s own tropical-get away right in their backyard and consequently, tourism became the islands main economic driving force.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> Tourisms preference of urbanization and massive displacement of indigenous communities from their cultural and natural resources enables corporations to view Hawai’i as theirs to use, take, and exploit.<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup>  At the time of statehood ‘Hawai’i residents outnumbered tourists by more than two to one’ while by todays estimates ‘tourists outnumber residents by six to one and outnumber Native Hawaiians by thirty to one’.<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup>  Native communities are plagued with adverse effects from a continuously growing tourism industry from when Queen Lili’uokalani was overthrown to modern day tourism that did not happen with and still continues without Native Hawaiian’s consent.<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup>  With the states major economic driving force focused on economic grow rather than cultural preservation, Native Hawaiian communities have been cultural exploited for almost a century and are forced to live among the creations of colonial rule and post-colonial decay.<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup> </p>

		 <p>The tourism industry within the state of Hawai’i has been and still is a threat to cultural and community identity that has ultimately diminished the status of Native Hawaiians among the states population.<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup>  The Hawaiian identity has been demolished and recreated into a kitsch, Americanized, and inaccurate version of its past self. Tourism in Hawai’i is centered round Hawaiian culture as its commodity and focal point to sell tourists from mainland America and elsewhere an ‘authentic’ Hawaiian experience for those want to exploit an ethnic subculture for their own entertainment. The advertisement of Hawaiian tourism paints a picture of a primitive yet romantic and erotic culture that can be consumed as ‘safe and soft savagery’ catered to the consumers ideal ‘other’.<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup>  In reality however, the globalization and tourism industry are destroying the very core of what they are marketing.<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup>  The degrading marriage of tradition and tourism ‘is a deal with the devil that perpetuates exploitation of Native’ people’s environment, values, cultural practices, and sacred places.<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup>  Many Indigenous peoples have found themselves in economic poverty due to the infiltration of tourism industries throughout every aspect of their life and are forced to sell themselves into ‘cultural prostitution’ to make a living. One of the most cultural exploited aspects of Hawaiian culture is the ceremony of Hula, which has been reshaped into the stereotypical image of a half-Caucasian, scantily clad, stick thin, amalgamation of Polynesian ‘native’ women used to sell trips to the Hawaiian Islands to mainland Americans.<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup>  Not only is the sexualized version of a hula dancer emotionally degrading and ethically wrong but it is also a completely inaccurate representation of what Hula is, what it is used for, and who practices it. This once sacred ritual of dance has now become a kitsch icon of Hawai’i and its now bybridized culture being exploited for commercial gain, stripping it of its cultural meaning to Native Hawaiians.<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup></p>
