		 <h3>From Contact to Statehood</h3>
		 <p>Contact between the United States of America and the Kingdom of Hawaii created a downward spiral of loss of identity and cultural solidarity between the Native Hawaiian communities. The relationship between the United States and Hawaii followed the U.S. expansion of power throughout the Caribbean during the 1890s causing the US to become a world power in distant countries around the North American continent.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="refl">1</a></sup> Economic turned into political influences upon the Hawaiian monarchy due to the vast amounts of commercial interaction it had with the United States government.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>  Soon the United States government took ahold of the Hawaiian monarchy eventually overthrowing the crown for its own economic and power hungry greed. Expensive commodities such as pineapple, sugar, and expansionist ideologies were the most alluring to the American government and economy subsequently causing the action of annexation of Hawai’i in 1898 despite unprecedented opposition of Native Hawaiian residents. The protests to annexation by the Indigenous community of Hawaii caused foreign policy complications right from the start. Two years after the annexation of 1898, Hawai’i became a United States territory in 1900 and later the fiftieth state in 1959.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> Unethically acquiring the Kingdom of Hawai’i, even to this day, the legitimacy of this annexation under U.S. constitutional law is rightfully scrutinized.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> </p>

		 <h3>Tourism</h3>
		 <p>The United States control over the Hawaiian Islands came from the economic trade benefits of commodities like sugar and pineapple however the U.S. government began to see the value of Hawai’i’s tropical paradise in relation to the socioeconomic changes in mainland American society.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>  As the twentieth century progressed, the newly emerged American middle class began to have access to international travel. Jet liners, a prosperous economy, more leisure time, and a morbid intrigue of experiencing ‘otherness’ and new places untouched by American capitalism and industrialism caused an influx of tourism into the Hawaiian Islands.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> Around the time of statehood, tourism expanded and soon advertised Hawai’i as America’s own tropical-get away right in their backyard and consequently, tourism became the islands main economic driving force.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> Tourisms preference of urbanization and massive displacement of indigenous communities from their cultural and natural resources enables corporations to view Hawai’i as theirs to use, take, and exploit.<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup>  At the time of statehood ‘Hawai’i residents outnumbered tourists by more than two to one’ while by todays estimates ‘tourists outnumber residents by six to one and outnumber Native Hawaiians by thirty to one’.<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup>  Native communities are plagued with adverse effects from a continuously growing tourism industry from when Queen Lili’uokalani was overthrown to modern day tourism that did not happen with and still continues without Native Hawaiian’s consent.<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup>  With the states major economic driving force focused on economic grow rather than cultural preservation, Native Hawaiian communities have been cultural exploited for almost a century and are forced to live among the creations of colonial rule and post-colonial decay.<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup> </p>
