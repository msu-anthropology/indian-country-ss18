      <h1>Art, Representation, and Appropriation</h1>
      <h3>Navajo Nation</h3>
	  <h4>•Chloe E. Wilson•</h4>
         <h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p> The Native tribes of the United States remain largely invisible to outsiders. We often see or imagine a stereotype, rather than the reality of Native peoples and their lives today. Their art, or rather imitations of their art, however, is seen in popular culture everywhere. It’s manifested on t-shirts, festival costumes, flasks – anything a typical American might be inclined to purchase. The fashion industry especially is guilty of playing off of Hollywood depictions of Plains Indians adorned in buckskin and feathers. The industry’s influence on American identity leads to this stereotyped image of Indians being the only image that we have, rather than the contemporary Native peoples and styles that are flourishing today. </p>
			<p>The fashion industry is also guilty of cheaply replicating Native art and crafts for economic gain, which reduces true art and design to merely a type of brand for corporations to use. This has been seen in fashion shows in which models were trussed up in headdresses, and it’s been seen in the abundance of knock-offs and imitations that find their way into stores and trading posts. Many consumers don’t pay any mind to where their souvenirs are coming from or who made them, which is the cause of the invisibility that Native peoples are experiencing.</p>
			<p>This webpage will detail the history of the traditional art of Navajo Nation, the art and crafts’ cultural significance, and a study of the misappropriation of such sacred art for the sake of capitalist gain. The Navajo have a rich, extensive culture which is very centered upon maintaining harmony on Earth. This page will also include information about and cases of misappropriation of Navajo art. The tribe’s art is widely popular and while replications are plentiful, these non-Native iterations appropriate the Navajo peoples’ very identities. Tips will also be included in this webpage concerning how to consciously purchase Native arts and crafts. </p>
