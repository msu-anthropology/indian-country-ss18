<h1><strong>Alaskan School System</strong></h1>
      <h3>A Contemporary Look at Alaskan Rural Education</h3>
	  <h4>Nicholas Mells</h4>
	  <br>
	  <br>
  <h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>
	  <hr>
<br>
<h5>
<p> Alaskan rural communities are nestled within a geographic space that is sparsely populated over many vast acres. When we describe schools we must also describe the communities that the are surrounded by.  Like many other demographically segregated communities certain communities denotate certain connotations and in the context of Alaska, when we say rural we are almost exclusively talking about a population of American Inidan and Alaskan Natives. 
This meaning that a large sect of the population served in the Alaskan rural school system are inadvertently categorized into a racial homogenous group.. This means that policy that is enacted to help the schools are in large part policies that will have a real-time and generational effect on the American Indian and Alaskan Native populations. 
In 2003 a federal report was published detailing the aggregated data collected from research into Native Americans as a newly categorized ethnic group. <em>“A Quiet Crisis: Federal Funding and Unmet Needs in Indian Country”</em> stated that 
As a group, Native American students are not afforded educational opportunities equal to other American students. They routinely face deteriorating school facilities, under paid teachers, weak curricula, discriminatory treatment, and outdated learning tools. In addition, the cultural histories and practices of Native students are rarely incorporated in the learning environment. As a result, achievement gaps persist with Native American students scoring lower than any other racial/ethnic group in basic levels of reading, math, and history. Native American students are also less likely to graduate from high school and more likely to drop out in earlier grades [U.S. Commission on Civil Rights 2003:xi]
Within knowing this context the aim of my research is to contextualize the historical, geographical, and the political factors that have altered the educational landscape for the American Indian & Alaskan Native population and to highlight the solutions proposed to fix these issues.
</h5>
<br><h4><strong> Geographical Analysis of Alaskan Rural Schools & Community </strong></h4>
<hr>
<br>
<h5><p>Known for its peculiar territorial embeddedness; villages and rural areas are nestled within vast expanses of forest, with transportation between state and local governments consisting of maritime or aerial traffic. This geographical problem has augmented an already palpable theme many Native communities are challenged with. With factors like isolation, cultural bias, and westernized education goals self-determination and governance begins to play a larger role within native communities in Alaska.

	<h5><figcaption>Map 1. Map of Alaskan School Districts.</figcaption><h5>
</div>
<p> This multi-jurisdictional patchwork of authority and resource management began to produce a wildly inequitable situation for children growing up the rural school systems here in Alaska. Though an even more challenging jurisdiction to navigate is that of the educational authorities governing these populations.
Research provided by sage Education writer Hollie J. Mackey best summarizes this challenge: “Education in Indian Country has become an increasingly contested space as policymakers at the federal, state, and tribal levels negotiate priorities and goals intended to improve academic achievement and promote cultural awareness in schools serving American Indian and Alaska Native students.”(Essa)
<br>
<br>
<strong>Labor Problems</strong>
<hr>
<br>
<p>When discussing the  labor challenges in terms of Alaskan schools a reoccurring narrative is present within every industry, retention & recruiting.
 “There is an increasing need for quality teachers in Indian schools. Due to rural isolation, low teacher salaries, high poverty, and differences in languages and cultures, it is difficult to recruit and retain quality teachers in Indian schools. Further, the need for special education teachers is growing since representation of AIAN students in special education is at 18 percent, almost double the rest of the student population at 10 percent.”(NEA Education Issues)
To compound this issue Alaska’s teacher turnover whether it be due to retirement, attrition, migration, or transfer must also be factored into this problem as well. With a significantly higher teacher turnover the most under-served students due to this geographical and resources management problem also has the least access to reliable teachers.
<br>
<br>
<strong> Teacher Turnover </strong>
“In Alaska, teacher turnover is consistently higher in rural schools and districts. At the district level, between 1999 and 2012, it averaged 20% in rural districts, and 10% in Alaska’s five largest districts which are mostly (though not entirely), urban or suburban (Hill & Hirshberg, 2013). At the school level, between 2015-2016 and 2016-2017, rural-remote schools had over 30% teacher turnover; schools in rural hubs had 22%, and in more populated areas the school turnover rate was 14-16% (Stevens & Pierson, 2017).” (UAA Center for Alaska Education Policy Research)

</p>
<br>
<br>
<strong> Historical Context of Alaskan Education</strong>
<hr>
<br>
<h5>
<p>The legacy of education policy that must first be acknowledged before attempting to have a contemporary understanding of the struggles facing American Indian & Alaskan Native (AIAN) populations is painful and has caused trauma to be felt on a generational level.  Hollie J. Mackey, an anthropologist studying native education, states that “Scholars have identified the historic tension found in federal Indian education laws and policies that have on one hand “purposefully and systematically worked to eradicate Native languages, religions, beliefs, and practices” (Lomawaima & McCarty, 2002, p. 282), while on the other, provide resources and infrastructure to support Indigenous control and cultural self-determination (Lomawaima & McCarty, 2002; Strommer & Osborne, 2014).” (Hollie J. Mackie)
Prior to Alaska’s statehood and the passing of the Alaskan Native Claims Settlement Act, Alaska was an American occupied territory bought from the Russians in 1867.  As Alaska traded hands, though not officially known or talked about by the indigenous people, policy began to change the cultural landscape of this region particularly in the form of religious back compulsory schooling.
The Education Policy that shaped this region was under the guise of extermination via assimilation. Boarding schools were established by missionaries with the help of the federal government to “kill the Indian and save the man”. Though in some cases these schools were an opportunity for native children to enter into the United States economy, countless reports have stated the cultural and emotional toll this traumatic experience had on the children that were subjugated under this policy.
In the 1930’s American Indian schools on reservations educated children until the 6th grade. While boarding school then became required after this to completer education (Coleman p.9). This all changed after the Great Depression and the New Deal era in the 1930’s. This new deal was called the Indian Reorganization Act. This act aimed at a style of governance that was heavily relient on self-determination and Native self governance. 
On December 18, 1971 the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act was formally enacted by the Congress of the United States to settle the land claims of Alaska Native people. (Ongtooguk). This act recognized the federal distinction of the indigenous people of Alaska.
 This designation made tribes incorporated entities in the eyes of the legal government. This act dictates the first precedent of the government to government relationship of all Alaskan Natives “ceding” their land to the United States Government. This act came to become infamous for ceding away a lot of land but it was at the narrative of the new fight for community governance. 
This same type of community governance and building of society via the backs of young people plays into the ongoing narrative of education in Alaska and in the United States. When discussing the historical context of Alaskan education what we are really studying is the “relation-ship between Indigenous peoples and the immigrant societies in which they are  embedded.”( Barnhardt) We are contextualizing the plurality of individuals and communities, and in doing so can then assess how to best serve students within these contexts. 

Notable Legislation impacting Native Education Policy 
<ul>
<li>Foreign dependent status</li>
<li>American Indian Boarding Schools (assimilation)</li>
<li>New Deal</li>
<li>No Child left Behind</li>
<li>Common Core</li>

<br>
<br>
<h5><strong>Culturally Responsive Pedagogy, “How should we teach?” </strong></h5>
<hr>
<br>
<p>
“Today’s classrooms require teachers to educate students varying in culture, language, abilities, and many other characteristics (Gollnick & Chinn, 2002).”(Richards) This means to have a more progressive view on education.  Educating the whole person so that they may better their surroundings while also bettering themselves. This ideal is in a constant thought war with a more capitalist view of the issue of schooling. This can be seen in an economic context i.e. “how to produce economic workers ready to enter the economy with a job and skill” when policy makers cut programs that do not “fill jobs”. </p>


<strong>How do we build better schools?</strong>
<hr>
<br>
<p> In the academic paper “Addressing Diversity in Schools: Culturally Responsive Pedagogy” three criteria are to be meet by educators in order to make the institution more culturally aware”
<ol>
<li>Organization of the school—This
includes the administrative structure
and the way it relates to diversity,
and the use of physical space in
planning schools and arranging
classrooms.</li> <li>School policies and procedures—
This refers to those policies and practices
that impact on the delivery of
services to students from diverse
backgrounds.</li>
<li>Community involvement—This is
concerned with the institutional
approach to community involvement
in which families and communities
are expected to find ways to become
involved in the school, rather than
the school seeking connections with
families and communities. (Richards)</li>
</ol>
The venn diagram below also denotes how to become more culturally pluralistic, combining two academic schools of thought in order to build a better rounded and more culturally aware student. </p>

<br>
<br>
<p>So what should an educational system, that is geographically isolated, and culturally pluarlistic do? They invest in more educational benefits[see section titled “Spending” for more], and begin to educate in ways that are culturally significant </p>

<strong>Next Steps For Alaskan Education</strong>
<hr>
<br>
The myriad of problems discussed so far have come from historical, political, and geographical contexts. But it can also be best articulated from the National Education Association, discussing the  complex issues facing community leaders and council; how to culturally and equitably engage in education practices that can benefit community. 
<p>Within the confines of Alaska, this problem has begun to gain some traction within media and the state government. With inequitable treatment and low test scores facing the state the Governor Bill Walker & current Commissioner of Education Michael Johnson have commissioned a task force named Alaska’s Education Challenge tasked to target the states low achieving school systems and to establish better programs and initiatives to educate students.
<br>
 As the councils convened, a specific committee was established to target tribal communities in assessing the needs and policies that would best suit community.
The Tribal  & Community Ownership subcommittee has set out its goals as:</h5>
<ol>
<li> Tribal/Education Compacting: Allowing tribes and native organizations the option to enter into self-governance compacts with the State of Alaska to gain more autonomy in the
management and delivery of their education system.</li>
<li>Values Allow and encourage regional areas to embed values in the education system.</li>
<li>Centering values around the place.</li>
<li>Partnerships – Strengthening relationships, expanding outreach, balancing power, with
various entities”</li> (Alaskas Education Challenge Tribal & Community Ownership Minutes)
</ol>
<p>	 
Through the funding of their own dollars, community engagement, and tribal compacting and partnerships an equitable alternative to the failing school system has been proposed. 
Alaskan Natives, and most if not all indigenous communities, have been subjected to the brutalities of being forced to assimilate in a system that historically diminishes indigeneity and sovereignty. 
To secure a spot for future generations of Native children the education system must be beneficial not only to them but must heal their community as well. 
 Leanne Simpson the author of “As We Have Always Done: Indigenous Freedom Through Radical Resistance” thoughts on the essence of the resurgence of indigenous education relies on her nishnaabewin to understand a decolonized idea of education. She states that healing a community from the trauma of colonialism must entail cultural education along with western ideals.</p>

<h4><strong> Spending </strong></h4>
<hr>
Where We are at now:

            <img src="images/anp5.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        <div id="aboutimgcenter">

        <div id="aboutimgright">
            <img src="anp1.png" alt="" />
        </div>
    </div>
<p> Thanks to the lobbying support of education groups and a reinvested government plan to prioritize education per capital student spending has reached number in the country with a high of $1,998.35. Though the per student spending was at a deficit in 2015 from the projected goal due to the economy crashing, Alaska has kept to their 20 year plan to increase the resources allocated for student success.
