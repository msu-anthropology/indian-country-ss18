      <h1>RESTRICTED FREEDOM</h1>
      <h3>HAUDENOSAUNEE</h3>
	  <h4>BY SHELBY ALLEN</h4>
	     <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
	     <hr>
	     
	     <p>Trying to prove that they were true nations, the Haudenosaunee along with Tim Coulter drafted what became The Declaration of Principles to improve Indigenous Peoples’ human rights not only in America but internationally.
	     This document, with additions and subtractions became the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. While this document has finally been recognized by the Obama administration, the fact that is has not been accepted as law continues to restrain the freedom of Indigenous Peoples.
	     Through vague wording and the removal of key elements, the Haudenosaunee and other Indigenous Peoples of America must continue to fight for their rights for full sovereignty.</p>

         <h3>THE HAUDENOSAUNEE CONFEDERACY</h3>

		 <p>The Haudenosaunee Confederacy, also known as Iroquois Confederacy, is comprised of six Native American nations under the Great Law of Peace. 
		 Some time ago, the five nations of Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca, were at war with each other(Haudenosaunee Guide For Educators, 2009).
		 Sent by the Creator, the Peacemaker sought out to spread Kariwiio, or good mind, to the nations in hopes of bringing them together. He, along with the help of Hiawatha, was able to teach the laws of peace and persuade the different nation’s Chief’s to join the Great League of Peace. 
		 The Peacemaker asked the tribes’ clan mothers to present to their Chiefs to place deer antlers on their heads as a symbol of their authority among the five nations (Haudenosaunee Confederacy). 
		 To bury any hatred and greed, He asked the men to throw their weapons into a hole and plant a tree on top naming it the Great Tree of Peace (Haudenosaunee Guide For Educators, 2009). 
		 The men then formed the Grand Council and made decisions and laws based on the Great Law of Peace to be carried out by the Nations. The Great Law of Peace is one of the earliest documents giving a basis for justice and rights to Indigenous Peoples. It allowed the Haudenosaunee to function with its own means of governing and allowed them to self govern (Haudenosaunee Guide For Educators,2009).</p>
		 <hr>
		 <h3>RECREATING PEACE AND ESTABLISHING JUSTICE</h3>
		 <hr>
		 
		
		 <p>Yet, even though the Haudenosaunee Confederacy had been working as an independent nation, governing itself for many years, the United States did not recognize them as such. Insisting they were true nations, Robert Tim Coulter started to represent the Onondaga Nation and the Haudenosaunee in 1975.
		  The Haudenosaunee thought the best way to assert their legal rights as a confederacy of nations was to appeal to the highest organization of governments:  the United Nations. By addressing this on an international level, he felt there would be more pressure on the United States and Canada to recognize these tribes as sovereign nations. 
		  In addition, this move internationally would assist other Indigenous Peoples around the world. One of the key conferences he attended was the Discrimination Against Indigenous Populations in America.  Here, Coulter found that recognition internationally and nationally of Indigenous Peoples’ human rights was imperative to survival. 
		  Following his attendance at this conference, he worked with the Haudenosaunee to begin to draft what would become the Declaration of Principles. This declaration became one of the foundational documents of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, or UNDRIP (50 Events That Shaped American Indian History, ).
		  The Haudenosaunee continued their efforts by leading a delegation of Indigenous Peoples to the human rights session of the UN in Geneva, Switzerland in 1977. This along with other appearances and intense lobbying “led directly to the creation of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues...” (George-Kanentiio, 2017).
		  These intense efforts by the Haudenosaunee to advocate for not only their rights, but all Indigenous Peoples rights, allowed UNDRIP to be formed.</p>

		  <h3>A STEP TOWARDS SOVERIEGNTY</h3>
		  <hr>
		  <p>UNDRIP became the first document intended to secure basic human rights for Indigenous Peoples globally, including “the preservation of spiritual and cultural identity, collective land and resource rights, and the right to exist as nations and peoples, to name a few”(Taliman, 2005). 
		  This document took around 30 years to be ratified and voted on at the United Nations. The declaration includes “a wide range of human rights related to religion, language, lands, natural resources, education, and economic and social issues” (Taliman, 2005). 
		  Along with basic Indigenous Human Rights, this declaration also “prohibits discrimination against indigenous peoples and promotes their full and effective participation in all matters that concern them, and their right to remain distinct and to pursue their own visions of economic and social development” (United Nations Adopts, 2007).</p>
		  <hr>
		  <h3>PROBLEMS WITHIN UNDRIP</h3>
		  <hr>
		  
		  <p>The drafting process of UNDRIP was a long process with committees being established to ensure Indigenous People’s demands be met as well as revisions constantly taking place. After World War Two, the United Nations was determined to create a peaceful transition from empires to independent sovereign states. 
		  The Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples was adopted in 1960 was intended to transition colonized territories from colonial rule to state governance. This lead to Indigenous Peoples around the world to seek out sovereignty and independence from the countries that rule them. 
		  “The UN was faced with demands by Indigenous Peoples for equal treatment under international law” (Henderson, 2014) and started the UN Working Group on Indigenous Populations, or WGIP, in 1982. 
		  States paid little attention to the group, which meant the Draft Declaration was almost entirely a “‘product of Indigenous Peoples’ representatives’ and reflects their interests most accurately” (Henderson, 2014).
		  However, during this drafting processes, states could block any Indigenous Peoples living in their territories from taking part in the drafting process. In 1993, the WGIP tabled the Draft Declaration and the Human Rights Commision started the Working Group on the Draft Declaration, or WGDD, to ready the draft for the General Assembly. 
		  After this group was started, states began to take interest and because both the terms ‘indigenous’ and ‘peoples’ were referred to indirectly in the draft leading to a fluid definition of ‘indigenous’ in the final version of UNDRIP, states could easily deny indigenous status to Indigenous Peoples.

		  </figure>
		  <br>
		  This, however, is only the start to the problems with UNDRIP. Before ratifying the document states required “‘a few slight accomodations’” (Henderson, 2014).
		  In between the process of the Draft Declaration and the final UNDRIP, Draft Article 34 had been removed, which “would have empowered indigenous peoples to ‘determine the responsibilities of individuals to their communities’, creating strong relationships of reciprocity” (Henderson, 2014).
		  This would have allowed indigenous communities to defend community rights. Along with deletions of key sections in the Draft, the rephrasal of wording lead to the weakening of the power of UNDRIP. For instance, the policy of free prior and informed consent is reworded to be interpreted as only a duty to consult on issues. 
		  Originally, this would have formed a basis for relationships and agreements between states and Indigenous Peoples but instead with the rephrasing, states only need to prove they consulted with Indigenous Peoples not that the obtained their approval. Another problem with UNDRIP was the reinterpretation of international norms. 
		  Self-determination was historically understood as the “establishment of a sovereign and independent State, the free association or integration with an independent State, or the emergence into any other political status freely determined by a people…” (Henderson, 2014).
		  During the ratification of UNDRIP, a two week session was held in December bringing Indigenous delegations from around the world, including the Haudenosaunee, the Navajo Nation, and the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, together to protect and enhance their rights in self-determination. 
		  Many countries participating in this session “agreed to recognize a genuine right of self-determination for indigenous peoples, some fearthat indigenous nations may try to secede and form independent countries” (Taliman, 2005).
		  The United States, New Zealand and Australia proposed to redefine the right to self-determination leading to the word to meaning Indigenous Peoples are only allowed certain administrative powers in their communities (Henderson, 2014).
		  After many years of disapproval and debate, a final document was in place to be voted on at the United Nations.</p>

		  <h3>A STEP BACK FROM SOVEREIGNTY</h3>
		  <hr>

			<figcaption>Image 3 - President Obama Meeting with Tribal Leaders</figcaption>
		</figure>
		  <p>In 2007, after many debates and changes to the original declaration, 143 Member States voted in favor of the UNDRIP, approving the document as a non-binding text. While this declaration was one of the biggest steps forward for Indigenous People’s rights around the world, four countries including the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand voted against the document (United Nations Adopts, 2007).
		  The United States never signed on to the document and it took until 2010 for the Obama Administration to announce its support of UNDRIP when Obama met with tribal leaders. Some Indigenous Peoples started to ask why Obama wasn’t pushing to have it be a part of American law (Capriccioso, 2011). Congress needs to vote on the document and ratify it in to law, causing a hold on the declaration being recognized as such. 
		  The administration still made it clear though that it didn’t see the document as legally binding, but the support was still welcomed (Capriccioso, 2011).
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  Today, we see a shift in recognition of human rights under the new Trump administration. With him going back on his word and constantly going against international agreements and bodies, such as the Human Rights Council and the Paris Agreement, it is more important today than ever to have international advocacy for the rights of Indigenous Peoples in America. 
		  Even though the United States didn’t sign on to the Declaration, it is still a valid international policy and human rights treaties are still legal obligations of the United States. The declaration is a document of rights and values recognized in consensus around the world. Indigenous Peoples in the United States can begin to build movements and use this document in their legal work (How the UN).
		  However, the success of UNDRIP and its use by Indigenous Peoples in America all depends on whether or not the government chooses to get past the status-quo of traditional federal-tribal policy (Capriccioso, 2011).</p>
