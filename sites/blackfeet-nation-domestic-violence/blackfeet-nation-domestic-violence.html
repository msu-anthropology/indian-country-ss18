		 <h3><u>Brief History on Women of the Blackfeet Nation</u></h3>
		 <p>Unlike the patriarchal society instilled through Anglo-American ideals as a result of colonialism, historically the Blackfeet Nation placed more emphasis on the roles and contribution of the women in the community. Women of The Blackfeet Nation historically were regarded as sacred contributors in terms of the position they played in the community. According to research found through The Empty Shawl Report, as well as, Joseph S. Gladstone and Donald D. Pepion women of the community were viewed as sacred individuals that aided in keeping the community continuing because of the various important roles they played within it (The Empty Shawl, 2009; Joseph Scott Gladstone & Donald D. Pepion, 2016). Women were responsible for not only maintaining the homes but also teaching the children the traditions of their society. Women also took on leadership roles when it came to taking care of and trading pelts. Gladstone and Pepion relayed findings from early reports stating that indicated the importance of women when it came to trade, stating how a trader from Hudson’s Bay claimed that he witness women taking very “assertive” roles in trade of pelts for their communities (Joseph Scott Gladstone & Donald D. Pepion, 2016).</p>

		 <h3><u>Domestic Violence in the Blackfeet Community</u></h3>
		 <p>According the Department of Justice “The term ‘domestic violence’ includes felony or misdemeanor crimes of violence committed by a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabitating with or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse or intimate partner, by a person similarly situated to a spouse of the victim under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction receiving grant monies, or by any other person against an adult or youth victim who is protected from that person’s acts under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction” (Department of Justice, 2017).</p>
	<br>
		 <p>Although the Department of Justice provides a definition for domestic violence that much of the laws in the United States reflect to be the overarching definition in terms of legal matters, it is not reflective of all communities and cultures views on the subject matter. With contributions from the article by Chester, Barbara, et al., scholar Sherry Hambry found that “There are many factors, some centuries old, that are specific to particular tribal groups and that affect the context and definition of domestic violence in native communities” (Hambry, 2000). </p>
		 <br>
		 <h4><u>Statistics</u></h4>
		 <br>
		 <h4><u>Secondary Victims</u></h4>
		 <p>When abuse occurs, such as domestic violence in these indigenous communities, there are generally secondary victims who reap the effects of the abuse besides just the victim. These secondary victims tend to be the children of the home or relationships. At The Empty Shawl Conference on domestic abuse specifically on Montana’s tribal reservations it was reported that “Children from homes where battery occurs may be up to <strong>15 times</strong> more likely than their peers to be physically abused and neglected themselves, and girls with violent fathers are much more likely to be sexually abused” (The Empty Shawl, 2009, p. 6). The report continued to say that with prior exposure to abuse and violence, children are more prone to continue the cycle of abuse within their own personal such as struggling with alcohol and drug abuse and they are “<strong>six times</strong> more likely to commit suicide than children in the general population” (The Empty Shawl, 2009, p. 6).</p>

		 <h3><u>Policy Changes and Community Resources</u></h3>
		 <p>With the large number of domestic violence incidents on the Blackfeet Reservation and on Indigenous lands in general in Montana, various organizations have been created in hopes to aid victims and create a safe-place to turn when in need. Some of these organizations are for the entire state, while there are other resources that focus on the needs of Indigenous women with respect to the traditions and culture of the Blackfeet community. Some examples of these include:</p>
<br>
<strong>The Montana Native Women’s Coalition</strong>
<p>Montana Native Women’s Coalition (MNWC) is a subsect of a larger Native nonprofit organization that was founded in 2001. MNWC “aims to improve urban, rural, and Native American community responses to victims of Sexual and Domestic Violence, provide culturally based training/technical assistance to tribal advocacy, programs and communities. MNWC seeks to improve collaboration between Native women leaders and State/Federal representatives who manage funding for sexual and domestic violence programming in Montana and create social changes through the elimination of institutional, cultural and societal violence against Native women and children” (Montana’s Native Women’s Coalition, 2001). </p>
